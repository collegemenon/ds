Hypothesis tests, or statistical hypothesis testing, is a technique used to compare two
Datasets, or a sample from a dataset. It is a statistical inference method so, in the end of
The test, you'll draw a conclusion— you'll infer something — about the characteristics of
What you're comparing.

A hypothesis test is usually composed by
Null hypothesis (h0, read "H zero"): States that all things remain equal. No phenomena
            Is observed or there is not relationship between what you are comparing;
Alternative hypothesis (h1, read “h one”): States the opposite of the null hypothesis.
            That there was some change, or observed relationship
